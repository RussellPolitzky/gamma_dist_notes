Consider the use of GLMs for claims reserving when creating stochastic versions of the chain ladder model.

When using:

1.) A Gamma distributed response variable, and
2.) Development period as a categorical variable, so that the GLM finds a separate 1/(development factor) 
    estimate for each development period 
3.) The inverse link function with 
4.) The claims reserved at the start of each development period as weights

The coefficient values obtained from the development factor samples using the GLM method as formulated 
above, are found to match 1/(volume weighted values), obtained using the basic chain ladder method, exactly.  
Similarly, since the link function is the inverse function, the predicted values match the volume weighted
values exactly.

Construct a rigorous proof, showing that this formulation of the chain ladder problem provides an 
exact match for the volume weighted chain ladder, development factor estimates.
